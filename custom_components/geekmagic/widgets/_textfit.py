"""Real font metrics for Python-side text fitting.

Blitz draws no ``text-overflow`` ellipsis and does not clip text to
``overflow: hidden``, so anything that might not fit has to be measured
and truncated before it reaches the markup. Measurement goes through
``blitz_py.measure_text`` (>= 0.3.0) — the engine's own shaper over the
same embedded font collection it rasterizes with, one source of truth
for layout math done in Python. That includes the engine's system-font
fallback, so CJK titles measure at their real fullwidth advance.

Measurement is theme-aware, which matters more than it sounds: themes
are full stylesheets and may transform their labels. Built-in themes
render with Noto Sans KR, so Latin, Hangul, and mixed strings are fitted
with the same face that Blitz draws.

The module also answers the inverse question — "how big can this string
be and still fit?" — which is how hero values get sized to their cell
instead of to a one-size-fits-all ``clamp()``.

The true fix remains native ``text-overflow: ellipsis`` in blitz-dom,
tracked upstream in the blitz-py repo (docs/UPSTREAM.md there).
